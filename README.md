# Welcome to DeciderBot
Are you an indecisive person who can't decide between something and don't want to rely on someone else? If I just described you, then DeciderBot is for you!

DeciderBot is a low-level bot that helps you decide between your desired amount of options. It is written in Python by me, John Fiore, a high school student from the suburbs of Chicago, IL. I made it because I, myself, am a very indecisive individual who was tired of flipping coins and going to others, who weren't as indecisive as I am, to decide for me.

Support me on ko-fi for future development (optional, no pressure): https://ko-fi.com/johnfiore
